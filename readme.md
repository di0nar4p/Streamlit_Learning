# Learning Streamlit

Welcome to my Streamlit learning repository! ðŸŽ‰

## About

In this repository, I am exploring and learning the concepts of Streamlit, an open-source app framework specifically designed for Machine Learning and Data Science projects. Streamlit makes it incredibly easy to build custom web apps for machine learning and data science, all in pure Python.

## What is Streamlit?

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that allows you to create interactive, web-based applications with just a few lines of code. It is particularly useful for:

- Visualizing data and models
- Building machine learning applications
- Creating data dashboards

With Streamlit, you can turn data scripts into sharable web apps in minutes. All you need to do is write Python scripts and Streamlit automatically converts them into interactive apps.

## Why I am Learning Streamlit

- **Ease of Use:** Streamlit's simple API allows me to quickly prototype and deploy data applications.
- **Visualization:** It offers powerful data visualization capabilities that can help in presenting my data insights in an interactive way.
- **Integration:** Streamlit easily integrates with various data science and machine learning tools and libraries, making it a perfect choice for my projects.

## Current Progress

I am currently focusing on the following topics:

- Setting up a Streamlit environment
- Understanding the basic concepts and components of Streamlit
- Building simple interactive web applications
- Exploring advanced features and functionalities

## How to Run the Projects

To run the projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/di0nar4p/Streamlit_Learning.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Streamlit_Learning
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run index.py
    ```
